`Part 101 <https://www.aviation.govt.nz/assets/rules/consolidations/Part_101_Consolidation.pdf>`_
=================================================================================================
Horizons currently has no RPAS policy. Thus, the main rules governing the use of RPAS are CAA Part 101. The main rules are:
- Keep clear of aircraft
- Fly below 400ft above ground level (AGL)
- Keep RPAS within visual line of site
- Cannot fly within restricted airspace or 4km of airport without permission from CAA
- Cannot fly at night

Massey does a CAA certified `RPAS Course <https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/colleges/college-business/school-of-aviation/study/rpas-course/rpas-course_home.cfm>`_ where you can get an in depth knowledge of the rules. This is not a requirement to fly a RPAS.

`AirShare <https://www.airshare.co.nz/>`_
=========================================

- Need permission from Air Traffic Control (ATC) to fly in restricted airspace (coloured polygons)
- Use AirShare to log flights and gain clearance with ATC
- Good practice to also log flights with AirShare for unrestricted airspace
- Also contains information on how to safely operate a RPAS

Land Permission
===============
You need to get permission from the landowner/council to fly on private/public land.
If you are unsure if permission has been granted, it is best to ask again.

- Do not fly near animals or people
- Disarm the RPAS when approached by animals/people
- Stay 20m or more away from boundaries, pathways, and roads

A good analogy is that cyclists of the sky.
