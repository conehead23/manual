==========
Inspection
==========
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure employees can pick up this device and carry out environmental data collection/water metering.

Procedure
=========

- On the iPad, open the Mobile Capture app

.. image:: /images/inspection_mobile_capture.PNG
   :target: ../_images/inspection_mobile_capture.PNG

- The initial screen displays a list of inspections that have been loaded to the device. The + will give you more details about the inspection such as:

    - When the inspection is scheduled
    - Type of inspection
    - Bore number and name of the consent
    - HSN (logger ID) number
    - ATH number
    - Purpose of the water abstraction
    - Company name
    - Contact number

- Another option of finding inspections is the map tab. The colours and numbers on the inspections make no sense and tend to change. To open the inspection, select the window that appears when an icon is pressed

Inspection Date/Time
--------------------
Ensure the current date/time is selected NZST.
If an older time is present, the inspection has been opened and may have entered data. Still, set the current date/time.

Some examples of site instructions:

- Farmer wants you to ring him before entering
- Specific paths to follow. A map can also be drawn in the :Photos:
- Passcodes or locations of keys

If nothing is of note, select :guilabel:`NOT APPLICABLE`

Meter Details
-------------
Check the meter details with the meter

- Ensure the serial number is that of the flowmeter not the display unit
- If missing/incorrect details, update and select :guilabel:`YES`
- Else, select :guilabel:`NO`

Logger Details
--------------
Check the meter details with the meter

- If the meter is completely different, eg Point Orange compared to Harvest, start cursing because someone forgot to do the inspection when installing
- Else, correct any minor mistakes and select :guilabel:`NO`


Taking a Flowmeter Reading
--------------------------
- Data source should be flow meter 1.
- The next field is the previous meter reading.
- Note the reading on the meter and

Krohne

The navigation controls are based on light. Cover the down arrow once to get to the :guilabel:`-Σ÷` menu.

Krohne Display

Press down arrow once, should get to total flow. Reading is Σ1

Dial Meter
``````````
These are old piles. Take the reading from the number the point has just PASSED. Note the order of the decimal places. This meter reads 324125.930 m3

Octave
```````
This meters display reads 4810.74 m3.

Taking a Logger Reading
-----------------------
The next field is about the logger, the logger will have a serial number a previous reading and a current reading. Then we have the multiplier field which is where we select the amount of water that flows before the logger receives a pulse. Now we have the ratio this is what tells us if our readings line up.

Select :guilabel:`Menu` > :guilabel:`Input` > :guilabel:`Digital Input` > :guilabel:`Digital input 1`. This number is the logger reading
